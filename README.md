# Design of digital currency backtest system based on breakout strategy of moving average
## Introduction
Our project is a digital currency backtesting system based on the moving average breakthrough strategy. In the strategy section, we use the moving average breakout strategy to generate trading signals, a buy signal when the closing price crosses the moving average, and a sell signal when the closing price crosses the moving average.
